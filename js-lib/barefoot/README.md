# Barefoot
A lightweight [Bigfoot.js](https://github.com/lemonmade/bigfoot) alternative in Javascript to create beautiful footnotes.

## How does it work?

Barefoot grabs the common markup used for footnotes on the web, mostly generated by Markdown processors, and transform it into beautiful and meaningful footnotes.

```html
<p>
  <sup id="fnref1:1">
    <a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a>
  </sup>
</p>

...
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    ...
    <li id="fn:1">
    <p>I'm a footnote&nbsp;<a href="#fnref1:1" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref">â†©</a></p>
    </li>
    ...
  </ol>
</div>
```

It's very easy to start Barefoot, just do the following:

```html
<script src="dist/js/barefoot.min.js"></script>
<script>
  lf = new BareFoot();
  lf.init();
</script>
```

## Customization

There's little to no customization in Barefoot, you can change a few selectors, scopes, templates. Barefoot also lacks several options available in [Bigfoot.js](https://github.com/lemonmade/bigfoot), such as activating footnotes on hover, allowing multiple footnotes, etc. If you need those options or more customization, please check [Littlefoot](https://github.com/goblindegook/littlefoot).

## History

I know barely nothing about Javascript nor have the resources to test this on a larger scale. I decided to build Barefoot after noticing several bloggers loading jQuery exclusively for Bigfoot. See, this is how cool [Bigfoot.js](https://github.com/lemonmade/bigfoot) is, we load an entire library just to have quirky footnotes.

## Support

IE10+ since the script uses a lot of `classList`, which is unavailable on IE9. The script contains polyfills for `Element.matches` and `Element.contains`.
